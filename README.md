# Song Explicitness Prediction with Logistic Regression

Using logistic regression, I wanted to predict whether a Twenty One Pilots song would be explicit or not based on its musical features.

## Datasets I Used
- **Training Dataset**: A dataset of top artists on Spotify, including song features and explicit labels.
- **Test Dataset**: A separate dataset containing songs from Twenty One Pilots to evaluate my model.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for building machine learning models (Logistic Regression)
- Matplotlib for visualization

## Results
- My logistic regression model achieved 80% accuracy on the dataset of Twenty One Pilots songs
